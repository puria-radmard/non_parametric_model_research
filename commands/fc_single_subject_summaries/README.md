Plan:
1. Fit 8 models (est/cue/full/sns * ws/vm+unif) to single subject and aggregated data
2. Compare BICs on all data
3. Generate synthetic data from each model
4. Do raw error histogram minus best fitting vm+unif for both this synthetic data, and compare the same to real data (no model needed for real data here)


**Also:** do all of the above for N=1 but with the vM*vM emission distribution case too...
