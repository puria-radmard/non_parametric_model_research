Plan:
1. Dip into data generated from full model trained on all subjects' data, e.g. in `/homes/pr450/repos/research_projects/error_modelling_torus/results_link/fc_subject_aggregated_summaries_7_10_24/mcmaster2022_e2_dircue_medC/full_wrapped_stable_0/synthetic_data_single_subject_cross_fit.npy`
2. Train a set full/cue only model on just single subjects data
3. If these models fail to identify that full fits better, i.e. via BIC, then we should progress with better fits of the single subject data, e.g. HBM methods
